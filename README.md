# Neural Network Regression Model with TensorFlow/Keras

A new product forecasting method integrating industry domain knowledge and an artificial neural network model. Industry expertise and feature engineering was used to carefully craft the model, precluding the need for a large dataset.
This repository contains a neural network implementation for a regression task, built using TensorFlow/Keras and scikit-learn. The model is designed to predict a continuous target variable based on engineered features extracted from an Excel dataset. It includes data normalization, training-validation-testing split, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.
